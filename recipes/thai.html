    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Thai Basil Chicken is arguably the gold standard of Thai Chicken stir fries! An incredibly fast and easy Thai recipe that truly tastes just as good as youâ€™ll get at your favourite restaurant, served over jasmine rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp brown sugar</li>
            <li> 2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sliced shallots</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp minced Thai chilies</li>
            <li>1 cup thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>2 cups hot cooked rice</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended.</li>
            <li>Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes. Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice.</li>
        </ol>
