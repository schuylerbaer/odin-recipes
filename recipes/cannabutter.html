    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Cannabis butter, also called cannabutter, is the most tried and true cannabis-infused recipe known to the culinary cannabis world.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup cannabis flower</li>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Decarb the cannabis. Preheat your oven to 245ºF. Place cannabis buds on a non-stick, oven-safe tray. Cover the tray with parchment paper to prevent sticking. Insert the tray into the oven and set a timer for 30-40 minutes. Older, drier cannabis may require less time. (Tip: you can also set your oven to 300ºF and heat for 10 to 18 minutes, although low-and-slow is the recommended approach when decarbing to better preserve the cannabinoids.) Every 10 minutes, gently mix the buds with a light shake of the tray to expose the surface area of the buds equally.</li>
           <li>Grind the decarboxylated cannabis coarsely with a hand grinder.</li>
           <li>Add 1 cup of water and 1 cup of butter into a stock pot or saucepan. Simmer on low and let the butter melt. Adding water helps to regulate the temperature and prevents the butter from scorching.</li>
           <li>As the butter begins to melt, add in your coarsely ground cannabis product.</li>
           <li>Maintain low heat (ideally above 160ºF but never exceeding 200ºF) and let the mixture simmer for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally. The mixture should never come to a full boil.</li>
           <li>Set a funnel on top of a jar and line it with cheesecloth. Once the butter has cooled off, pour it over the cheesecloth funnel and allow it to strain freely. (Tip: Squeezing the cheesecloth may push more bad-tasting plant material through).</li>
           <li>If excess water forms at the bottom of the jar, you can remove the solid butter with a knife and drain the water out. (The butter will need to refrigerate for about an hour before removing the water.)</li>
           <li>Dose carefully.</li>
        </ol>
